# Commander

## Design Patterns

1. Command Pattern
   What It Is: The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing, or logging of operations, and support for undoable actions.
   How It’s Used: The core essence of Commander.js is the Command pattern. Each command (e.g., program.command('install')) is an object that encapsulates an action, its arguments, and associated behavior (via .action() callbacks). The library decouples the invocation of a command (e.g., node script.js install) from its execution logic, which is defined separately. This separation allows users to define commands declaratively and execute them dynamically based on user input.
2. Builder Pattern
   What It Is: The Builder pattern constructs complex objects step-by-step using a fluent interface, improving readability and flexibility.
   How It’s Used: Commander.js employs a fluent API, allowing users to chain method calls to build up a CLI configuration incrementally. This is a hallmark of the Builder pattern, where the program object is gradually configured with commands, options, and behaviors.
3. Facade Pattern
   What It Is: The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, hiding underlying complexity.
   How It’s Used: Commander.js acts as a facade over the complexities of CLI parsing (e.g., handling process.argv, parsing flags, managing subcommands). Users don’t need to manually parse arguments or implement help text generation—Commander.js abstracts these details into a clean API.
4. Singleton Pattern (Implicit via Module System)
   What It Is: The Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
   How It’s Used: In Node.js, the module system naturally enforces a singleton-like behavior due to caching. When you require('commander'), you get a single instance of the program object per application. While Commander doesn’t explicitly enforce a singleton class, its usage assumes a single CLI program instance per script, aligning with this principle.
5. Strategy Pattern (for Extensibility)
   What It Is: The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable within a context.
   How It’s Used: Commander.js allows users to define custom actions for commands via .action() callbacks, effectively letting you plug in different "strategies" for handling input. Additionally, features like custom option parsing (via .addOption()) or subcommand delegation (via executableFile) support swapping out behavior dynamically.

Design Principles

6. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
   What It Is: A class or module should have only one reason to change.
   How It’s Applied: Each Command object in Commander.js is responsible for a single task (e.g., defining a command’s behavior). The program object delegates parsing and execution, keeping responsibilities separated. For instance, option parsing is handled distinctly from command execution.
7. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
   What It Is: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   How It’s Applied: Commander.js is extensible without requiring users to modify its internals. You can add new commands, options, or even custom parsing logic (e.g., via .addOption() or .hook() for lifecycle events) without touching the library’s core.
8. Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)
   What It Is: Avoid duplication by abstracting common logic into reusable components.
   How It’s Applied: Commander.js eliminates repetitive CLI boilerplate (e.g., argument parsing, help generation) by providing reusable abstractions. Features like automatic --help generation or version handling reduce redundant code in user applications.
9. Loose Coupling
   What It Is: Components should depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, reducing interdependencies.
   How It’s Applied: The Command pattern in Commander.js decouples command definitions from their execution logic. Subcommands can even be separate executable files, further reducing coupling between the main program and its parts.
10. Encapsulation
    What It Is: Hide implementation details and expose only what’s necessary.
    How It’s Applied: Commander.js encapsulates the complexity of argument parsing, error handling, and lifecycle management behind a simple API. Users interact with high-level methods like .option() or .command(), unaware of the underlying mechanics.

# Effect/cli

## Design Patterns Utilized

1. Factory Pattern
   @effect/cli uses a compositional approach to build CLI applications, as seen in its API like Command.make and CliApp.make. These methods suggest a factory-like structure where commands and CLI applications are created with predefined configurations (e.g., options, arguments). This allows for reusable and modular command definitions.
2. Composite Pattern
   The library supports nesting commands and subcommands (e.g., add and clone in the minigit example). This hierarchical structure aligns with the Composite pattern, where complex CLI structures are built from simpler, reusable components (commands, options, etc.).
3. Builder Pattern
   The configuration of commands via a Config object (with options and arguments) resembles the Builder pattern. Developers incrementally define command behavior, options, and arguments in a fluent, step-by-step manner, improving readability and maintainability.
4. Strategy Pattern
   The handling of platform-specific services (e.g., integrating with @effect/platform-node for Node.js) suggests a Strategy-like approach. The core CLI logic remains agnostic to the runtime environment, and specific behaviors (e.g., file system access) are delegated to interchangeable platform modules.

## Design Principles Utilized

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
   Each command and subcommand has a distinct purpose, and the library separates concerns like command definition, parsing, and execution. Built-in options like --help and --version are handled automatically, reducing the responsibility of individual command implementations.
2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
   The library is extensible without modification. Developers can add new commands, options, or platform integrations (e.g., via @effect/platform) without altering the core @effect/cli codebase.
3. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
   @effect/cli depends on abstractions (e.g., platform-specific services provided by @effect/platform) rather than concrete implementations. This is evident in its requirement to pair with a platform module like @effect/platform-node.
4. Composability
   A key principle emphasized in its tagline ("Rapidly build powerful and composable command-line applications"). Commands and options can be composed to form complex CLIs, promoting reuse and modularity.
